##Core

- Based off given code, create an endpoint in the DishesController that sends a 
list of dishes using the DishService
- Create an index.html that iterates through and displays the names of the dishes sent from the
controller in an unordered list using thymeleaf.
- Create an endpoint that uses the DishService to get a singular dish based off 
parameters from the url
- Create a show.html that displays a dish's name and description using thymeleaf

##Based off time left

- Create a thymeleaf template new.html that contains a form for a new Dish and
an endpoint to render it
- Create a post endpoint to receive the form information and redirect to the index
page to see your new dish!
